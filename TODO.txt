Things to do in the future:

- [X] Remove hardcoded IP and port, maybe using a .ini file on both the server
      and client

- [ ] Compile the client with Meson instead of Make and unify client and server
      into a single Meson project

- [ ] Add pretty UI for the client :3

- [ ] Support for Windows

- [ ] Add a icon to the ROM
